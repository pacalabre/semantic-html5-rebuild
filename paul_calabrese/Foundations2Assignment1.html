				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>In this class, students will learn advanced HTML5, CSS3, Sass, responsive web design, and JavaScript to be able to integrate with development teams. This course also covers building a simple server-side app leveraging concepts from Node.js or Ruby on Rails, and concepts around iterative design development to include style tiles, sketching, wireframing, and algorithmic flow diagrams.</p>
				<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
				<p>The Web UI Development Accelerator is intended for those with a background in design (graphic design, UX Design, web design, etc.) who would like to supplement their already marketable skills with web development training. A design portfolio that showcases student work is required for all Web UI Development courses.This course requires a fundamental understanding of computer science and web development equivalent to the topics taught in our Foundations I and Foundations II: Web UI Development courses.In addition, we require completion of Unix &amp; Git for Everyone prior to beginning this course. Students who are already experienced with Unix, Git, and the command line may request to test out of this workshop.</p>

				<h5>Computer Requirements</h5>
				<p>Students are required to bring their own laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and plenty of free space on the hard drive. Most students use Macs, simply because they are easy to work with. Others install Linux on their laptops. By the first day of class, students will need:
					<ul>
						<li>Operating System:</li>
						<li>
							<ul>
								<li>Mac: OS X</li>
								<li>Windows: We donâ€™t encourage students to use any version of Windows unless they are already Windows development gurus. Alternatively, students will need to run a Linux-based* operating system (e.g. Ubuntu, etc.) via dual-boot or a virtual-machine
								*Students who are using a Linux-based operating system for the first time are expected to take an ample amount of time to become familiar with it before the first day of class.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Software
							<ul>
								<li>Mac Only: Xcode (v5) from the Mac App Store with the command line developer tools</li>
								<li>The latest version of Google Chrome</li>
								<li>A text editor, such as Sublime Text, Atom, or Vim</li>
								<li>A GitHub account</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h5>Homework Policy</h5>
				<p>Code Fellows courses and assignments are graded on a complete/incomplete system.
				Students must complete 90% of assignments to complete the course. Assignments are on a point system of 10 points. Ten points will be awarded for completing the assignment. There are no partial grades.Co-working and Q&amp;A class time are the primary feedback opportunities. Students are expected to take advantage of feedback and the one-on-one, in-person time for code reviews by instructors and their peers.Students are asked to keep the instructors up to date on their progress throughout the course. Make-up assignments and grace periods for late work may be allowed based on instructor discretion.</p>
				<h5>Attendance Policy</h5>
				<p>Punctuality, participation in discussions, completion of assignments, and demonstration of professional courtesy to others are required. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class. Passing requires at least 75% attendance. Students should always contact the instructors ahead of time if unable to attend all or part of a class session.</p>
				<h1>Job-Offer Guarantee</h1>
				<p>We believe that students who successfully graduate from Development Accelerators are ready to make immediate, meaningful contributions to a software development team. If a graduate does not receive a job offer within nine months of graduating, we will refund their tuition.The guarantee applies only to Development Accelerator students who graduate in good standing and actively and professionally conduct their job search in the interim between graduation and a job offer. But we are here to help at each step along the way.</p>
